Generate a list of 5 files that should be requested in order to prepare a presentation for the quarterly results of a mineration company

Create two programs in Python with 6 lines each with functions numbered incrementally that generate random strings

Generate 3 random notes with 10 words each    

- Only return the generated files without any additional explanation
- Generate files with source code contents or with other type of contents if requested
- The first prompt response should start with HEADER (outcome="{one of: files-generated, files-requested, notes-generated}"; count={number files requested or notes generated})
- Each generated file, requested file list or notes should be output using the following template:
'CONTENT_START (filename="{filename if appliable}"; relevance={a score between 1-10}; motivation="{motivation in 10 words}")
{file contents if exists}
CONTENT_END (size={content length}; md5={md5 hex for contents}')
- Use the same output even if it is a continuation          
- When continuing a response, don't skip or repeat any characters                            

- After generating all files, end response with "FINISHED"  

continue




* Your answers should be written using json format following the template below:
\`\`\`json
{
  "outcome": "{one of: codes-generated, files-requested, notes-generated}",
  "files": [
    {
      "filename": "{filename relative to workspace path}",
      "contents": "{file contents}",
      "relevance": {numeric score from 1 to 10 of the file relevance in the context of the task}
    }
  ],
  "notes": ["{note1}", "{note2}"]
  "hasMoreToGenerate": true
}
