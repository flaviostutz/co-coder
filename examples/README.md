# Examples

Example usage of the lib.

This runs during release pipelines also to check if the lib is working while being used as an external lib.

This example was copied from [cdk-practical-constructs](https://github.com/flaviostutz/cdk-practical-constructs) so we can exercise a more complex application with infrastructure and backend code along with some custom architecture to see if LLM can reason on the structure and create things on top of it.
